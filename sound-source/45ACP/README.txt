Original free 1911 .45 ACP sample sourced here: http://www.zapsplat.com/music/1911-handgun-pistol-semi-automatic-45-gunshot-behind-shooter-stereo-2/

The free version was only lossy MP3 format, but since guns are basically noise anyway, it didn't hurt the quality much.
Sample is trimmed, echoes attenuated, and is re-equalized to reflect what real .45s sound like to me, then transcoded to ogg.
